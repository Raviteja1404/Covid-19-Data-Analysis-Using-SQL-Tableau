COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Using Tableau

This project uses Tableau to analyze COVID-19 data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE). The project includes four analyses:

Global Numbers: This analysis provides a snapshot of the global COVID-19 pandemic, including the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Total Deaths Count per Continent: This analysis shows the total number of COVID-19 deaths for each continent.
Percent Population Infected per Country: This analysis shows the percentage of the population that has been infected with COVID-19 for each country.
Percent Population Infected X: This analysis shows the percentage of the population that has been infected with COVID-19 for a specific date range.
Key Findings

The total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide has exceeded 620 million, and the total number of deaths has exceeded 6.5 million.
The Americas and Europe have been the two continents most affected by the pandemic, accounting for over 70% of all deaths.
The United States has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths of any country in the world.
The percentage of the population that has been infected with COVID-19 varies widely between countries, from less than 1% to over 70%.
The percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 has increased over time in most countries.
Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world, both in terms of human life and economic activity. The data analysis in this project provides insights into the global and country-level trends of the pandemic. These insights can be used by policymakers and public health officials to make informed decisions about how to best respond to the pandemic.

Additional Analysis

In addition to the four analyses described above, Tableau can also be used to perform other types of analysis on COVID-19 data. For example, Tableau can be used to:

Identify the demographics that are most at risk from COVID-19.
Analyze the effectiveness of different public health interventions, such as lockdowns and mask mandates.
Track the spread of new variants of COVID-19.
Forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic.
Tableau is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze COVID-19 data in a variety of ways. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform decision-making at all levels of government and society.
